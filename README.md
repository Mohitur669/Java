# Programming in Java

Hi, I am Mohd Mohitur Rahaman, a 1st-year student in the MCA Department at Kalinga Institute of Industrial Technology (
KIIT). I started to learn Java last month (27th June,22). So, I created this repository to share what I learned and also
to provide some solutions for popular problems along with my learning journey. If you want to contribute or can
optimize/add any code further, then please create a pull request.
