Hi, I am Mohd Mohitur Rahaman, student of MCA at Kalinga Institute of Industrial Technology (KIIT). I have started to learn Java since last month (27th June,22). So, I created this repo to share what I learned and also to provide some solutions for popular problems along my  learning journey. If you want to contribute or can optimize any code further, then please create a pull request.
